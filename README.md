# reactionTimeTester
This is a simplistic tool for measuring the reaction time.
This test is influenced by the latency of your computer and display in addition to assessing your response time. Your score will increase if you use a fast computer and a low-latency, high-framerate display.

## Instructions
- Attempt to click anywhere on the screen or press the space key as soon as the background color turns white.
- Press the space key or click anywhere on the screen to start playing.
- The background color will change at any time after two seconds of clicking.

### The average response time for elite track athletes is between 120 and 160 ms, whereas F1 drivers often have 200 ms. See if you can beat that!
